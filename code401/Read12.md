### [What Is Panda](https://www.activestate.com/resources/quick-reads/what-is-pandas-in-python-everything-you-need-to-know/)
( I found this article very helpful )
Pandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of another package named [Numpy](https://www.activestate.com/products/python/python-packages/), which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays. As one of the most popular data wrangling packages, Pandas works well with many other [data science](https://www.activestate.com/products/python/python-data-science/) modules inside the Python ecosystem, and is typically included in every Python distribution, from those that come with your operating system to commercial vendor distributions like ActiveState’s [ActivePython](https://platform.activestate.com/featured-projects).

- A fantastic library of tools to perform data analysis

Among many other functions, Panda can intelligently process a dataset intpo clean tables.

.describe - Will give you a clean breakdown of different values in your dataset
.drop - allows you to drop specific catagories of values from your dataset
.value_counts - access the counts of given argument values
.mean - will give you mean on a given column of the dataset
you can combine different catagories to perform compairisons or just organize your data with .groupby - than handing a set of arguments
